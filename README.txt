if you dont end up opening the .md readme.

Hi Thank you for reviewing my Drop Down Component
This app was built on Create React App toolchain,
Thus to install dependencies type in terminal - npm install 
			            then type - npm start
quick notes there is a custom horizontal scrollbar that auto hides, use that to navigate through selected items in closed state.
	-There is also one for verticle scrolling in the open state!
Your good to go :)! -Jun
